Purpose for this  program was to create a  connect 4 game. This game was created for two ppl where one player is the red piece while the other player is yellow piece. Once the game is over then it will display a text, indicating which player has won and then terminate the program.

Key Concepts in this program was learning to use the library pygame which essntially created the main gaming screen. To create the board it was baded on simple 6x7 matrix  in the command line and then based on the coordinates of each position in the matrix I was able to use that in the acutally pygame widget. Another factor was the mathematical equations I used  that was would be able to indicate when its 4 in a row, posiitve slope, negative slope, vertical, and horizontal.
